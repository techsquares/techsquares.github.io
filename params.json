This is an issue of public health, as it crime affects physical and psychological wellness. Acts of crime can and do result in physical harm, psychological trauma or disorder, death or incapacitation. We want students to be aware, be safe, and to find support if they are victims.\r\n\r\n### Effects of Crime on Health\r\n\r\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists “Campus Safety and Security” as a major health concern for college students, freshman in particular. One might not think of safety and security as a public health issue. Campus safety and security is as much a health issue as it is a policy and legal issue, as victims of crimes on campus are subject to mental or physical harm. Crimes affecting the mental and physical health of students include rape, burglary and theft. Victims of such crimes may experience:\r\n\r\n* Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\r\n* Anxiety Disorders\r\n* Panic Disorders\r\n* Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\r\n* Social Phobia\r\n* Depression\r\n\r\nEntering college, young adults advancing from the secondary schooling environment to the post-secondary schooling environment face health challenges related to management of stress, maintenance of physical health, and eating a proper and nutritious diet. These are common topics of discussions related to the student health. A less noted and less discussed health issue -- of equal importance -- is <i>campus safety and security\r\n\r\n### 2015 Statistics (Most Recently Available)\r\n* Rape: 10\r\n* Burglary: 27\r\n* Motor Vehicle Theft: 17\r\n* Robbery: 7\r\n* Aggravated Assault: 3\r\n* Fondling: 2\r\n\r\n### Safety Tips\r\n1.
