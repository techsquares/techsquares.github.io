<p>One might not think of safety and security as a public health issue. Campus safety and security is as much a health issue as it is a policy and legal issue, as victims of crimes on campus are subject to mental or physical harm. According to the most recent data available in the Georgia Tech Police Department Safety Report, in 2015, there were 27 burglaries, 7 robberies, 17 motor vehicle thefts, 3 incidents of aggravated assault, 2 incidents of fondling, 10 incidents of rape on campus; all these crimes subjected victims to harm or danger. This report of criminal incidents is issued in accordance with the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990 and the Clery Act.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Context</h3>

<p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists “Campus Safety and Security” as a major health concern for college students, freshman in particular. Entering college, young adults advancing from the secondary schooling environment to the post-secondary schooling environment face health challenges related to management of stress, maintenance of physical health, and eating a proper and nutritious diet. These are common topics of discussions related to the student health. “The freshman 15” has even become a cultural meme, referring to weight gained eating on fast food and generous dining plans, free of parental guidance and regulations. A less noted and less discussed health issue is campus safety and security. </p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Law</h3>
<p>The Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990, amending the Higher Education Act of 1965 Title IV that set up Federal financial assistance to post-secondary institutions, required institutions recipient of Federal funds under Title IV are required to disclose campus safety and security statistics. </p>

<p>The Clery Act requires post-secondary institutions to disclose the location of on-campus crimes, the agency to which each on-campus crime is reported, the classification of the on-campus crime, and the year in which each on-campus crime is reported.</p>

<p>
  According to the U.S. Department of Education Handbook for Campus Safety and Security, all colleges and universities are required to:
  <ul>
    <li>“Collect, classify and count crime reports and crime statistics.”</li>
  </ul>


“Issue campus alerts.”
“Provide educational programs and campaigns.”
“Have procedures for institutional disciplinary action in cases of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.”
“Publish an annual security report.”
“Submit crime statistics to the Department [sic].”
