<p>This PSA is intended to empower Georgia Tech students with knowledge of threats to the safety and security on campus and in the surrounding community. This is an issue of public health, as it crime affects physical and psychological wellness. Acts of crime can and do result in physical harm, psychological trauma or disorder, death or incapacitation. We want students to be aware, be safe, and to find support if they are victims. </p>

<p>One might not think of safety and security as a public health issue. Campus safety and security is as much a health issue as it is a policy and legal issue, as victims of crimes on campus are subject to mental or physical harm. Crimes affecting the mental and physical health of students include rape, burglary and theft.</p>

<p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists “Campus Safety and Security” as a major health concern for college students, freshman in particular. Entering college, young adults advancing from the secondary schooling environment to the post-secondary schooling environment face health challenges related to management of stress, maintenance of physical health, and eating a proper and nutritious diet. These are common topics of discussions related to the student health. A less noted and less discussed health issue -- of equal importance -- is <i>campus safety and security</i>. </p>

<p>The Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990, amending the Higher Education Act of 1965 Title IV that set up Federal financial assistance to post-secondary institutions, required institutions recipient of Federal funds under Title IV are required to disclose campus safety and security statistics. </p>

<p>The Clery Act requires post-secondary institutions to disclose the location of on-campus crimes, the agency to which each on-campus crime is reported, the classification of the on-campus crime, and the year in which each on-campus crime is reported.</p>

<p>
  According to the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) Handbook for Campus Safety and Security, all colleges and universities are required to:
  <ul>
    <li>“Collect, classify and count crime reports and crime statistics.”</li>
    <li>“Issue campus alerts.”</li>
    <li>“Provide educational programs and campaigns.”</li>
    <li>“Have procedures for institutional disciplinary action in cases of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.”</li>
    <li>“Publish an annual security report.”</li>
    <li>“Submit crime statistics to the Department [sic].”</li>
  </ul>
